# NLP
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield in Deep Learning that makes machines or computers learn, interpret, manipulate and comprehend the natural human language. 
Natural human language comes under the unstructured data category, such as text and voice. 
Generally, computers can understand the structured form of data, such as tables and spreadsheets in the database, since the human language, like text and voice,
comes under the category of unstructured data, and since computers can't understand the unstructured textual or voice data, NLP comes into action.
